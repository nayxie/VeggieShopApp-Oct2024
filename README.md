# Veggie Shop Management System

This project marks my first independent development of a full-stack web application, completed over 4 weeks in October 2024. Developed as the final assessment for the COMP642 Advanced Programming course at Lincoln University, the application implements a `Domain-Driven Design` approach, integrating domain models, database models, routers, services, and utilities.

The technology stack includes `Python with Flask`, `SQLAlchemy`, `Jinja templating`, `HTML`, `Bootstrap`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, and `MySQL`, with `Pytest` used for testing. This stack enabled the creation of a responsive and maintainable application that manages core functionalities of a vegetable shop.

## :tada: Layered Architectural Design

The application follows a layered architectural design. Each layer is separated according to best practices, making the architecture clean, modular, and easy to maintain.
